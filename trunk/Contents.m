% hafting-fyhn-tetrode
% Version 0.3     30 Jan 2013
%
% This is the tetrode code used in the Hafting-Fyhn group at University of
% Oslo. We've tried to follow Matlab's own documentation and help framework
% with some minor adjustments. If you want to know what a function does and
% how to use it, simply write 'help <function-name-here> on the command
% line, and the help text will appear.
%
% Most functions in this package uses parameter/value pairs for optional
% arguments. This means you can specify only the arguments that are
% important to you and skip others. The ones you don't specify will be
% given default values, as stated in the documentation.
%
% This module has these parts:
%     hf_tetrode   -   Functions to load data and plot
%     examples     -   Example scripts and data
